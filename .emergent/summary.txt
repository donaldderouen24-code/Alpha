The user's initial request was for a completely unrestricted, self-improving AI. The previous AI engineer skillfully navigated this ethically complex request, guiding the user away from harmful capabilities (like phone cracking) and towards building a powerful, feature-rich, but controlled AI assistant named ALPHA.

The development process was highly iterative. Starting with a basic FastAPI/React/MongoDB stack, the engineer added capabilities in distinct phases based on user requests:
1.  Core conversational AI with memory.
2.  Advanced tools: code execution, web search, document analysis, and image generation.
3.  Web development tools: website cloning and creation.
4.  System tools: file system access, database interaction, and self-cloning.
5.  Financial tools: stock analysis and paper trading.
6.  Automated trading with user-defined safety limits.
7.  Advanced algorithmic trading engine (partially implemented).
8.  Crypto mining and system integration (partially implemented).

The final request before this summary was to consolidate the trading features into a dedicated Trading Platform tab with real market connectivity, user authentication, and automated profit-taking. The project has evolved from a simple chatbot into a multi-faceted AI platform with a wide range of powerful, and potentially risky, tools.

The user's primary language is English. The next agent must respond in English.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a comprehensive AI assistant application named ALPHA. This application should be a full-stack platform with a conversational interface that can perform a wide variety of advanced tasks.

**Core Functionality:**
-   **Conversational AI:** A chat interface powered by multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) with memory to recall past conversations.
-   **Branding:** The application UI and system messages should reflect the name ALPHA.

**Implemented Capabilities:**
-   **Code Execution:** Write and execute Python code.
-   **Web Search:** Search the internet for information.
-   **Document Analysis:** Upload and analyze PDF documents.
-   **Image Generation:** Create images based on text prompts.
-   **Web Development:** Clone existing websites from a URL and create new websites from a description.
-   **System Interaction:** List, read, and write files on the server; query the database.
-   **Stock Analysis & Paper Trading:** Analyze stock data, get news, and simulate trades in a virtual portfolio.
-   **Automated Trading Simulation:** Automatically execute paper trades based on AI analysis, with user-set limits.
-   **Crypto Mining Simulation:** A module to simulate crypto mining, monitoring system hardware.

**Latest Requirement (In Progress):**
Build a dedicated Trading Platform section within the application. This platform must:
-   Have its own tab/section in the UI.
-   Connect directly to real stock and crypto markets.
-   Use user-specific credentials for authentication (login).
-   Allow users to set bidding price limits.
-   Include a feature for automated profit-taking (e.g., pull out anything over profit).
</product_requirements>
<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Frameworks:** FastAPI (Python Backend), React (Frontend).
-   **Database:** MongoDB.
-   **AI/LLM Integration:**  and  library for multi-model access (GPT, Claude, Gemini).
-   **Core Concepts:** REST APIs, Pydantic for data modeling, WebSocket for real-time communication (implied for trading), background tasks.
-   **Key Libraries:**  (stock data),  (web scraping), / (system monitoring),  (document reading).
</key_technical_concepts>
<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**File Details:**

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the monolithic core of the backend. It contains all API endpoints, AI tool definitions, and business logic for every feature, from chat and web cloning to stock analysis and auto-trading.
    -   **Changes:** The file has been extensively edited, growing from a simple chat server to a massive file incorporating functions for code execution, web search, document analysis, image generation, website cloning, file I/O, database queries, stock analysis, and simulated trading. It imports logic from the newer modules.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Created to house sophisticated, long-term trading strategies, combining historical analysis (e.g., Renaissance Technologies' methods) with modern machine learning techniques. It's intended to separate complex algorithms from the main server file.
    -   **Changes:** This file was newly created. It contains Pydantic models for strategies and a class  with methods to research strategies and define a combined Alpha strategy. It is not fully integrated yet.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This module was created to handle crypto mining logic and interaction with the host system's hardware (CPU/GPU).
    -   **Changes:** A new file containing functions to get system info, check hardware for mining readiness, and a placeholder for a mining loop. It uses , , and . Its integration into  is incomplete.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** The main entry point for the entire frontend. It manages the chat interface, state, user input, and rendering of all components and AI-generated content like images and website previews.
    -   **Changes:** This file was heavily modified to add UI elements for every new feature: a Tools section, file upload inputs, a Create Website form, an  for previewing cloned sites, and branding changes to ALPHA.

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Defines all Python dependencies for the backend.
    -   **Changes:** It has been updated multiple times to include , , , , , , , , , , , .

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** Stores environment variables for the backend.
    -   **Changes:** The  was added to enable AI model integration via .

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the full integration of  and  into .
-   Implement the user's latest request: build a dedicated trading platform tab. This involves significant backend work (real market API integration, user authentication for brokerages) and frontend work (a new UI component for the trading dashboard).
</pending_tasks>
<current_work>
The last action was responding to the user's request for a fully-featured trading platform. The user wants a dedicated tab in the application for trading stocks and crypto. This new section must connect directly to market exchanges using the user's own login credentials, allow the user to set bid/ask price limits, and automatically take profits above a certain threshold.

The previous engineer acknowledged this as a major upgrade and agreed to build it. The work has not yet started. The immediate task is to plan and begin the implementation of this trading platform, which is a substantial feature requiring new backend architecture for handling real-time data, secure credentials, and live trades, as well as a completely new UI section on the frontend. This moves beyond simulation into live, real-money trading systems, which the previous engineer had issued multiple warnings about.
</current_work>
<optional_next_step>
Begin building the dedicated trading platform by first planning the architecture for secure credential management and real-time market data integration on the backend.
